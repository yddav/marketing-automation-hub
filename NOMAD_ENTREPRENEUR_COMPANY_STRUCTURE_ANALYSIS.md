### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR APP DEVELOPERS

#### 1. **Source of Income Classification**
- Google Play payments come from **Google Ireland** (for EU)
- May be considered foreign-sourced income in some jurisdictions
- Important for NHR/territorial tax systems

#### 2. **VAT Obligations**
- If revenue > €40,000: Must register for EU VAT
- Google handles VAT collection (in most cases)
- Still need to file VAT returns in company jurisdiction

#### 3. **Payment Gateway Costs**
- Google Play uses own payment processing
- No additional Stripe/PayPal fees for in-app purchases
- Only 15% or 30% Google fee

#### 4. **Subscription vs One-Time Purchase**
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring revenue, better for projections
- **One-time purchases**: Higher Google fee impact
- **In-app purchases**: Subject to same fee structure

#### 5. **Multiple App Strategy**
- Can create separate companies per app/region
- Useful for tax optimization
- Adds complexity and costs

---

### 📱 ALTERNATIVE: APPLE APP STORE

For comparison, Apple's fee structure:

| Tier | Revenue | Apple Fee | Developer Gets |
|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Standard** | All revenue | 30% | 70% |
| **Small Business** | First $1M/year | 15% | 85% |
| **Subscriptions (Year 1)** | All revenue | 30% | 70% |
| **Subscriptions (Year 2+)** | Same subscriber | 15% | 85% |

**Similar to Google Play**, but with loyalty benefit for long-term subscribers.
