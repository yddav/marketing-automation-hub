"Let me show you what manual marketing looks like. To properly promote an app, you need to post to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, update your app store listings, send email campaigns, update your website, write blog posts, and track analytics across all platforms. That's 8+ different tools, 15+ login credentials, and 3-4 hours daily just to maintain basic presence."

**[1:00-1:30] The Development Trap**
*On screen: Code examples and API documentation*

"So you decide to build automation. You'll need social media APIs, email marketing integrations, analytics dashboards, content management systems, scheduling engines, and A/B testing frameworks. Our development team spent 8 months and $73,000 building this system. You don't have to."

**[1:30-2:30] Core System Demo**

"Here's the Marketing Automation Hub in action. This is the analytics dashboard showing real-time performance across all platforms.

"Email marketing for apps is complicated. You need welcome sequences, feature education emails, re-engagement campaigns, launch announcements, user milestone celebrations, and retention flows.
