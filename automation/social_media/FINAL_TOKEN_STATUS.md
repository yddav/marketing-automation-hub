## ⚠️ Current App Status: Development Mode

Your Meta app is in **Development Mode**, which means:

**✅ YOU CAN:**
- Post content to Instagram
- Post content to Facebook
- Create and publish media
- Schedule posts

**❌ LIMITATIONS (until app review):**
- Cannot read public page data (requires "Page Public Content Access")
- Cannot read some insights (requires "Page Public Metadata Access")
- Limited to test users and admins

---

## 🎯 What This Means for Your Campaign

**GOOD NEWS**: You can launch your campaign NOW!

**Your automation system can:**
1. ✅ Post to Instagram (@untrapd.hub)
2. ✅ Post to Facebook (Untrapd Hub page)
3. ✅ Schedule 210 posts over 30 days
4. ✅ Track successful posts

**The read errors are normal for Development Mode apps!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Launch Campaign Now (Recommended)
Your tokens work for posting! The validation errors are just for reading public data, which you don't need for posting content.

**Launch command:**
```bash
cd automation/social_media
node finderr-native-launcher.js
```

### Option 2: Submit App for Review (Future)
If you want to read public page data and insights, you'll need to submit your app for Facebook's review process.

**Required for review:**
- Privacy Policy URL
- Terms of Service URL
- App purpose explanation
- Screen recordings of app usage
