## 🎯 My Recommendation

**START WITH TWITTER-ONLY LAUNCH TODAY**

Why:
1. Twitter is 100% working and tested
2. Gets campaign running immediately
3. Builds momentum while we fix FB/IG
4. 90 tweets is substantial content
5. Can add other platforms as they come online

Then work on Facebook/Instagram in parallel using Option 2 (Live Mode).
