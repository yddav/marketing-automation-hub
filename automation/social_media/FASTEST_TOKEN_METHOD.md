# 🚀 FASTEST Token Generation Method

## The Problem
Facebook Graph API Explorer UI is showing permission errors. The app needs permissions approved.

## ✅ SIMPLE SOLUTION

**Click "OK" on the error popup**, then look at the Access Token displayed in the Graph API Explorer (top right).

**Copy that token** and give it to me - even if it only has basic permissions, I can create a direct OAuth URL that will properly request all 6 permissions.

## What I'll Do With It
I'll generate a Facebook OAuth authorization URL that:
- Pre-selects all 6 required permissions
- Opens the proper Facebook authorization dialog
- Bypasses the Graph API Explorer UI issues
- Returns a properly scoped token

## The Token You Need to Copy
Look at the top right of Graph API Explorer for:
```
Access Token: EAAKfzRq...
```

Copy that entire string and provide it, or we can run the authorization flow directly.
