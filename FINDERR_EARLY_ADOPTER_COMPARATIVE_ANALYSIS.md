## 💡 Key Insights

### Insight 1: The "Urgency vs Revenue" Trade-Off
- **Smaller limits** (2,000) = higher urgency (38% conversion) but lower total revenue ($312K)
- **Larger limits** (5,000) = moderate urgency (32% conversion) but higher total revenue ($358K)
- **Optimal solution**: Implement tiered milestones within larger limit to get both urgency AND revenue

### Insight 2: Community Network Effects Matter
- Larger early adopter base (928 in Option C) → lower churn (4.0%)
- Smaller early adopter base (784 in Option A) → higher churn (4.5%)
- **Impact**: 0.5% churn difference = $34K revenue difference over 24 months

### Insight 3: Paid Upgrade Pool Economics
- Option A: 65% of Month 24 revenue from paid upgrades (higher margin)
- Option C: 62% of Month 24 revenue from paid upgrades (lower margin)
- **Trade-off**: Option A has better margins, but Option C has higher total revenue

### Insight 4: Timeline Predictability
- Option A: Month 3-4 (fastest, highest execution risk)
- Option B: Month 4-5 (balanced, moderate risk)
- Option C: Month 6 (longest, lowest execution risk)
- **Recommendation**: Add deadline overrides to all options for certainty

### Insight 5: FOMO Fatigue Risk
