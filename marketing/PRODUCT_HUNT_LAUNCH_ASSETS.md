### **Maker Comment**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

After struggling with 25% activation rates across multiple product launches, we built Automated Hub Engine to solve our own problem.

The results? 80%+ activation rates, 60% fewer support tickets, and completely automated user journeys.

We've been dog-fooding this for 8 months across 3 product launches, and the data doesn't lie - users who go through our automated onboarding have 3x higher lifetime value and 85% lower churn rates.

What makes AHE different:
• Built for enterprise scale (100K+ interactions/hour)
• Predictive churn intervention (85%+ accuracy)
• Crisis management protocols (battle-tested)
• Real-time cross-platform orchestration

We're launching as a standalone product because the demand from other SaaS founders has been overwhelming.
