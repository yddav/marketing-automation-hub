## 📊 **DECISION POINTS**

### **🤔 Strategic Decisions Needed**

#### **1. FINDERR Pricing Strategy Validation**
```yaml
Current Decision: $6.99/month Android-only
Alternatives Considered:
  - $4.99/month (lower barrier, less revenue)
  - $8.99/month (higher revenue, fewer conversions)
  - Freemium model (complex, delayed revenue)
  
Recommendation: Proceed with $6.99/month
Rationale: Sweet spot for Android market, competitive advantage
Validation Needed: A/B test at launch
```

#### **2. iOS Market Re-entry Timeline**
```yaml
Current Decision: No iOS focus for 12+ months
Factors:
  - 50-60% higher customer acquisition costs
  - Complex App Store approval process
  - Lower conversion rates for subscription model
  
Recommendation: Monitor Android success, revisit in Q4 2025
Trigger for Reconsideration: $50K+ monthly Android revenue
```

#### **3. Hub Automation Scaling Strategy**
```yaml
Current Capacity: 4 platforms, unlimited content generation
Scaling Options:
  - Additional platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest)
  - Enterprise features (team management, white-label)
  - AI content personalization
  
Recommendation: Focus on current platform optimization first
Timeline: Evaluate scaling in Q2 2025
