## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Priority 1**: Audit ALL content created by SuperClaude Army agents for feature accuracy
**Priority 2**: Update finderr-prelaunch-templates.js with correct emergency wallpaper focus
**Priority 3**: Add "Coming Soon" sections to all marketing materials with v5.0/v6.0 roadmap
**Priority 4**: Update Google Play Store description with roadmap clarity

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for complete content audit and updates

## ✅ WHAT FINDERR V4.1 ACTUALLY DOES

**In Plain English:**

FINDERR turns your phone's lockscreen into an emergency contact billboard when your phone is lost. Anyone who finds your phone will see your emergency email and phone number displayed on the wallpaper, allowing them to contact you without unlocking your device.

You activate this by:
1. Sending an SMS ("EMERGENCY_ON") from another phone, OR
2. Clicking a button on the web dashboard (https://finderr.app)

The emergency wallpaper displays instantly via real-time synchronization, and your original wallpaper is automatically backed up and restored when you send "EMERGENCY_OFF" or click the restore button.

**That's it. That's what v4.1 does.**

GPS tracking, location history, geofencing, and remote lock are all coming in future versions (v5.0 and v6.0), but they are NOT in v4.1.
